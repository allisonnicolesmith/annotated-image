    <div class="container">
      <h4>VOWZ BAR</h4>
      <p class="text">“There’s an old Japanese expression, <i>ichigo ichie</i>. It means ‘one opportunity, one encounter,’” says Zen monk Kanwa Takeuchi. He’s reaching for a bottle of sake behind his bar in Fukuoka’s bustling Hakata district, and
        anyone on
        the hunt for
        some bartender wisdom would be hard-pressed to find a better sage. Takeuchi’s robed figure is partially obscured by a thin rag of smoke; I’ve lit a stick of incense, a standard gesture in Buddhist rituals, and part of the recipe for one of
        his signature cocktails, <i>Inori</i>, the Japanese word for prayer. “Every experience is unique and will never come again, so each moment should be cherished,” Takeuchi says. With an unhurried elegance, he captures the smoke with a cocktail
        shaker,
        cupping it over the top of the glass, and, in doing so, mixes my prayer into the drink.</p>
      <p class="text">Port city Fukuoka, the capital of Kyushu, Japan’s most southwesterly island, exemplifies <i>ichigo ichie</i> better than most—the city’s urbanity is distinguished by its ability to reinvent the present with innovative ideas,
        while also
        treasuring
        the past, and nowhere is this felt more deeply than in its local cuisine. Many Japanese culinary traditions trace their origins here: <i>tonkotsu</i> ramen— the city’s star—characterized by its fatty pork bone broth, as well as hot pot dishes
        <i>motsunabe</i> and <i>mizutaki</i>. Jotenji Temple, built in 1242 in the heart of Fukuoka, even has a stone marker bearing the inscription, <i>udon soba hassho no chi</i>, or, “the place where udon and soba were first made.” But, like the
        seemingly misplaced
        monk Takeuchi, today a new generation is reinventing Fukuoka’s eating and drinking scene through cross-cultural fusion and modern food trends.
      </p>
      <p class="text">Framed by crimson walls accented with calligraphy brushstrokes, at first glance, Takeuchi’s Vowz Bar (<a href="https://vowzbar-hakata.jimdo.com/">fb. com/vowzbar.hakata</a>; drinks from ¥1,000) looks like a stylized fantasy of
        the East, but his egalitarian approach to booze
        consumption
        dispels any stereotypes. Most might think monks and alcohol don’t mix, but Takeuchi holds firm that his Buddhism-inspired cocktails can bridge the gap between spirituality and the daily demands of modern life. “It can be difficult for people
        to meet with a monk for spiritual guidance because of work schedules,” he tells me. “But most people drink alcohol at night after work. If monks go out to bars with the people, then we can meet, talk, and bring people closer to Buddhism.”</p>
      <p class="text">At Vowz Bar, Buddhist tenets are reimagined through specialty cocktails. The <i>Ichigo Ichie</i> can be personalized with your choice of alcohol, reflecting the phrase’s ephemeral wisdom. A spicy vodkabased cocktail, Samjiva,
        named
        after one of the
        realms of hell, offers a kick. “Every drink has a special meaning, a story behind it,” he says, hopeful that these messages will act as a catalyst for spiritual connection.</p>
      <h4>SAMURAI UDON</h4>
      <p class="text">With a similar attitude to his culinary ethos, chef Hiroyuki Soma’s samurai-like dedication to Fukuoka’s most underrated noodle suggests it’s udon, not rock and roll, that will save the world. Samurai. Udon (<a
          href="samurai-udon.com">samurai-udon.com</a>;
        mains from
        ¥850), his aptly named restaurant, is a standout for its handmade noodles and locally sourced ingredients. Yet it’s Soma’s eagerness to collaborate with other chefs from all cultural backgrounds that makes his shop special.</p>
      <p class="text">Soma says udon’s base components—flour, water and vinegar—are the key to merging cultural borders, “its ingredients make it a very versatile dish, so as long as I have those three parts, I can blend udon with many other cuisines
        to create
        something new.” Balling his hand into a fist for emphasis, Soma proposes that “udon culture could even ease international conflicts, like North Korea and Donald Trump.” His brand of optimism, characterized by the breadth of its vision, has
        resulted in an impressive array of culturally experimental dishes—more than a hundred, according to Soma—and nearly two dozen restaurant collaborations. Whether he uses Korean sauces or horse meat, or buries his noodles beneath a mound of
        spicy South Asian curry, Soma is eager to infuse his udon with a global awareness. Despite his restaurant’s mounting popularity, Soma remains modest: “I don’t know if my restaurant is that unique. This is just the most natural way for me to
        express myself.”</p>
      <h4>NUMBER SHOT</h4>
      <p class="text">Toshiyuki Morimoto is another local chef who is motivated to reinvent local dishes with a modern sensibility. At his <i>izakaya</i>-style seafood restaurant Number Shot (<a
          href="(foomanlab.com/fish-market-1">foomanlab.com/fish-market-1</a>; mains from ¥1,250), his menu remains
        true to the
        cuisine’s roots. Despite Fukuoka’s diverse food scene, it isn’t a tourist hub like Tokyo or Kyoto; Morimoto hopes that combining French-style cooking with Kyushu cuisine and locally sourced ingredients will introduce the city as an
        international culinary superstar. My appetizer is a promising start. <i>Mentaiko</i>—Fukuoka’s famed spicy cod roe—is rolled in an omelet and wrapped in sliced Hakata-style pork belly, combining two local specialties into a deceptively
        simple
        concoction.</p>
      <p class="text">However, it’s Morimoto’s signature main, Number Shot Doria, that leaves me spinning in the best possible way. Though <i>doria</i> is Italian in name and origin, the rice gratin dish was introduced to Japan 90 years ago by a
        Swiss chef
        whose version
        bakes melted cheese over a bed of steamed rice and Bechamel sauce. Instead of rice, Number Shot’s re-interpretation showcases Kyushu seafood; mussels and crab pop on the tongue, delicately rich and buttery soft. It’s also one of the most
        attractive dishes I’ve ever seen, garnished with sea urchin and little orbs of roe that shimmer like precious stones. Like many foods I’ve encountered here, it’s never the same dish twice. The fish selection changes daily, and the vegetables
        are seasonal; in springtime, they’ll swap mushrooms for bamboo shoots.</p>
      <p class="text">Number Shot, and Fukuoka at large, are places of juxtaposition. Despite the trendy interior, and the larger metropolis surrounding it, this is not a place where one checks the time or hurries off to the next hotspot. Like many
        restaurants
        throughout Japan, the shoulder-toshoulder dining nature along the communal counter invites strangers to interact, while the exposed kitchen in the center evokes the theatricality of a playhouse.</p>
      <h4>CHEZ RÉMY</h4>
      <p class="text">Departing into the chilly night, I’m guided by the far-off lights of <i>yatai</i>, wooden food carts, an anachronistic culinary tradition that survives in Fukuoka despite the city’s modern urban landscape. Wheeled out at dusk
        and gone
        again by the
        break of dawn, <i>yatai</i> stalls date back to at least the 17th century, and were widespread throughout Japan. In preparation of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, however, many were shut down due to increased sanitation standards. Since then, their
        prevalence has diminished by more than half, though Fukuoka has taken strides to preserve the custom. Yatai ownership used to be exclusively familial until 2016 when Fukuoka’s local government began accepting new applications.</p>
      <p class="text">Enter: Rémy Grenard, a Normandy-born chef and baker living in Fukuoka since 2001, who is the first non-Japanese to operate his own yatai, called Chez Rémy, which opened last spring. (<a
          href="fb.com/yataichezremy">fb.com/yataichezremy</a>; mains from ¥650).
        Grenard began
        introducing his homeland’s cuisine to Fukuoka when he opened his French bakery, La Tartine, in 2016, and continues to bake its authentic croissants, brioche and quiches before his work at his yatai begins in the evening.</p>

            <h3>Decline</h3>
            <p>In the 1960s, there were roughly 400 <i>yatai</i> carts, but today that number has shrunk to less than 100.</p>

            <h3>Work</h3>
            <p>Running a <i>yatai</i> is hard work. Most open around 6pm and don't shut down until 1am. After closing, the <i>yatai</i> needs to be cleaned, packed up, and wheeled to its storage spot. Most of the day is spent preparing food.</p>

            <h3>Telas and Mico</h3>
            <p>Steps away from Chez Rémy, chef Kensuke Kubota, who was worked at numerous Michelin-star restaurants, runs his own <i>yatai</i> called Telas and Milo, which serves fare tpyically found at British gastropub – homemade sausages and mash,
              bruschetta and tandoori chicken skewers.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <p class="text">At Chez Rémy, what sets his ramen apart is the French-style bouillabaisse broth topped with a hearty helping of mussels, shrimp and potatoes, instead of the usual sliced pork. It’s a savory dish that warms your belly, especially
        when paired
        with his boundary-pushing European sides, such as French-style pumpkin gnocchi, and seasonal mulled wine.</p>
      <p class="text">The decision to serve ramen began as a back-and-forth debate with a friend who insisted he add the dish to his <i>yatai</i> repertoire. Laughing, Grenard admits he was skeptical at first: “I don’t want to make what everyone else
        is
        making—I want to
        be myself,” he recalls saying.</p>
      <p class="text">This commitment to individualism has paid off. Chez Rémy draws large crowds each night, due in part to its original ramen dish, as well as Grenard’s willingness to accommodate vegetarian palates—not possible in most pork-laden
        <i>tonkotsu</i>
        broths—all of which is further buoyed by his breezy personality. As he hopscotches between French, Japanese and English, prompting conversation with customers, while calling out directions to his staff, he is both charming and impressive.
      </p>
      <p class="text">Vestiges of the past permeate Fukuoka’s landscape, from festivals celebrating centuries-old events to elderly women clad in traditional kimono boarding the rush hour train. Time is easily lost to idleness, but Fukuoka’s recent
        wave of
        culinary creatives has left a stamp on the present, transfiguring local staples through modernity, as they understand better than anyone else: this moment will never come back again.
      <p class="text">Grenard makes a toast: “<i>Ichigo ichie</i>.”</p>
      <p class="text">“That’s an interesting adage,” remarks the diner next to me, a Tokyo-based expat visiting for work.</p>
      <p class="text">“It means…” But I stop him short. I’m well-versed by now in the divine opportunity of singular culinary encounters.</p>
